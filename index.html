                <p>The Food Stamps program, later renamed Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), was created in 1964 as a means of providing food-purchasing assistance for low-income Americans.  Individuals receive on average $125 per month to purchase eligible food items.  Those applying to the program earn 130% or less of the federal poverty line.</p>
                <p>The number of people receiving SNAP benefits rises and falls with changes in poverty and unemployment.  Enrollment in the program tends to rise when the economy is in a recession, indicating that the program is performing its role in providing Americans with a social safety net during times of hardship.</p>
                <p>As of 2015, 14.3% of Americans were receiving SNAP benefits.</p>
