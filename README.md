# Food Insecurity in the U.S.

This project explores what food insecurity in the United States looks like along with participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through a series of visualizations.  It is based on a final project I worked on for my data visualization class in graduate school three years ago with the data updated.

## Data Sources:
- Current Population Survey, Food Security Supplement (Dec 2014) from the US Census Bureau
- SNAP National Level Annual Summary from the US Department of Agriculture
- American Community Survey 5 Year (2010-2014) from the US Census Bureau
